I see it\u0027s shipped in this path from long so wondering what made it issue now may be you can add some reference like bug / patch etc for background. The change itself shouldn\u0027t be an issue unless and until someone relying on the /usr/share path.\n\nAlso example-distgit needs to be fixed.\n\n\n[1] https://review.rdoproject.org/codesearch/?q\u003ddatadir.*api.*paste.*.ini\u0026i\u003dnope\u0026files\u003d.spec%24\u0026repos\u003d",

We need to make\nsure that when we update all the openstack service packages, we do it\nin a way that doesn\u0027t break the previous overriding behavior.  the\n*-dist.confs were always lower precedence than the main config. I\u0027m\nuncertain that moving them into *.conf.d/ would maintain that.\n\nNot saying not to change this but should consider past bugs and concerns.",
